# Some design decisions I've made (let me know what you think)

- No "honey pot", because you mentioned that bumblebees don't centralize their honey. (could you give the source for that? I know there probably isn't a report, but just in case they ask)
- Instead of defining all the globals in the code, I'm putting them as sliders. (I suspect it makes the code more understandable)
