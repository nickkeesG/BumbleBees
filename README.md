# Some design decisions I've made (let me know what you think)

- No "honey pot", because you mentioned that bumblebees don't centralize their honey. (could you give the source for that? I know there probably isn't a report, but just in case they ask)
- Instead of defining all the globals in the code, I'm putting them as sliders. (I suspect it makes the code more understandable)
- In their model, there really isn't anything 2 dimensional, as the bees just hop to random locations in each zone. It's just displayed 2 dimensionally. I think we should actually make the model 2d (and possibly stress this as our unique improvement)
